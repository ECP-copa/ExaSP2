This is ExaSP2 version 1.0
=========================

ExaSP2 is a reference implementation of typical linear algebra
algorithms and workloads for a quantum molecular dynamics (QMD)
electronic structure code. The algorithm is based on a recursive
second-order Fermi-Operator expansion method (SP2) and is tailored
for density functional based tight-binding calculations of
material systems. The SP2 algorithm variants are part of the Los Alamos 
Transferable Tight-binding for Energetics (LATTE) code, based on 
a matrix expansion of the Fermi operator in a recursive series 
of generalized matrix-matrix multiplications. 
It is created and maintained by Co-Design Center for Particle 
Applications (CoPA). The code is intended
to serve as a vehicle for co-design by allowing others to extend 
and/or reimplement as needed to test performance of new 
architectures, programming models, etc.
