data: This contains example matrices in Matrix Market Format.
These matrices serve as input Hamiltonians to CoSP2.
They represent different size polyethylene chains, 512 and 1024
molecules.

hmatrix.512.mtx - 512 molecules, 3072 atoms, 6144 orbitals,
N = 6144, M = 256.

hmatrix.1024.mtx - 1024 molecules, 6144 atoms, 12,288 orbitals,
number of non-zeroes = 196608, N = 12288, M = 256.
